# Pokedex React Redux-Saga

As an avid pokemon fan and frontend developer I wanted to find a project that combines the two.

I discovered the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) a free comprehensive api with tons data I could work with, while building my frontend skills.

I have yet seen a project that truly takes advantage of the verbose data that the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) has to offer, while delivering a feature rich user experience. I'm sure some pokemon fans could find it helpful and learn some fun facts about their favorite pokemon.

With [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) for state management and to handle async calls. React to normalize the data and use react Hooks.

Check it out [here](https://pokedex-matthewl-sudo.vercel.app/)

## Technologies used/Features include:
* React - using builtin hook and custom hooks.
* Scss - Sassy CSS, a necessity in any frontend developers repertoire.
* [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) - Solving complex state management issues and enable your components to interact with the Redux store.
* Redux-Saga middleware - An intuitive Redux side effect manager. Easy to manage, easy to test, and executes efficiently.
* Api consuming - PokeApi data.
* CSS Grid - For Mobile Responsiveness.
* DeepDash - Tree traversal library written in Underscore/Lodash fashion. To help sort through large objects
* Dark Mode option - coming soon

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
